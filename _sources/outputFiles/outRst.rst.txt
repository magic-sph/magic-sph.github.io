.. _secRestartFile:

Restart files ``checkpoint_*.TAG``
===================================

.. note:: These frequency of writing these files are determined by the standard
 inputs mentioned in the section on :ref:`restart files <secRstIn>` in the
 :ref:`output control namelist <secOutputNml>`. If nothing is specified then, by
 default one restart file is written at the end of the run.
 
.. note:: A restart file is read **only** when :ref:`l_start = .true. <varl_start>`

These are unformatted fortran files containing a snapshot of information about
spectral coefficients and physical and grid parameters. As the name suggests,
these files are used to 'restart' a run from a specific time. One such file is
read by the code at the beginning and are used as initial conditions for the
run. These are very useful for continuing a simulation for a long time on
computing clusters where the time for a single run is limited.

The file to be read at the beginning is specified by the input parameter
:ref:`start_file <varstart_file>` which takes in a string providing path to the
file.

These files are written by the subroutine :f:subr:`store <storeCheckPoints/store>`.

The following notations will be used for the coefficients of potentials
(note that scalar fields like temperature and pressure do not have a poloidal/toroidal
decomposition):

    +----------------+-----------+------------+
    | Field          | Poloidal  | Toroidal   |
    +================+===========+============+
    | Magnetic       | :f:var:`b`| :f:var:`aj`|
    +----------------+-----------+------------+
    | Velocity       | :f:var:`w`| :f:var:`z` |
    +----------------+-----------+------------+
    | Temperature    |      :f:var:`s`        |
    +----------------+-----------+------------+
    | Pressure       |      :f:var:`p`        |
    +----------------+------------------------+

Time derivatives are denoted with a self-explanatory notation. e.g, :f:var:`dbdt` is the first derivative of :f:var:`b`.

The word ``Last`` appended to a variable name denotes that the value is of the
time-step previous to the one during which the file is being written. They are
needed for the time-stepping schemes.

``_ic`` with a variable name says that it belongs to the Inner Core.
